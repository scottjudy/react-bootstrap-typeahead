Usage questions
======================
Unless you believe you've encountered a bug or want to request a feature, the issue tracker isn't the right place for getting help with your code. This format is not well-suited for Q&A, and questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. Before you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:

- Read the docs: https://github.com/ericgio/react-bootstrap-typeahead/tree/master/docs
- Try the examples: http://ericgio.github.io/react-bootstrap-typeahead/
- Look for/ask questions on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=react-bootstrap-typeahead
